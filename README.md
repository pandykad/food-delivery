    - The price is tracked and updated using the useRef hook
- useEffect hook is used to fetch the data from the DB on the initial load up of the pages
- Used React Router and useNavigate hook to handle routings

#### Node.js and Express.js
- Created REST API to perform CRUD operations on the DB
- Made use of JWT tokens to store user information in caches
- Used Bcrypt.js to encrypt and decrypt passwords stored in the DB
- Axios was used to make API requests
